# Scenario 1
msgid "MM_scenario1_name_text"
msgstr "APPROACH OF AZATHOTH"

msgid "MM_scenario1_desc"
msgstr "At the center of infinity slumbers Azathoth, lulled to sleep by the ceaseless piping of accursed flutes. Yet some mortals would seek to draw the infinite power and calamity of the Blind Idiot God to them, and thereby doom all of humanity..."

msgid "MM_scenario2_desc"

msgstr "VEIL OF TWILIGHT"

msgid "MM_scenario3_desc"

msgid "MM_scenario4_desc"
msgstr "In his house at R'lyeh, dead Cthulbu waits dreaming. He slumbers and waits until the stars are right to bring R'lyeh back from its home beneath the waves and for the Great Old Ones to return. For that is not dead which can eternal lie, and with strange aeons even death may die."

msgstr "SHOTS IN THE DARK"

msgid "MM_scenario5_desc"

msgid "MM_scenario6_desc"
